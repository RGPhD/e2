# Project 2
+ By: *Robelyn Garcia*
+ Production URL: <http://p2.robelyngarcia.me>

## Game planning
*Player 1 and Player 2 both shoot a three pointer from the top of the key. Each player will either make their shot or miss their shot. A made shot is worth THREE points; a missed shot is worth ZERO points. The player with the least points is Knocked Out and the player with the most points Wins the game and is the MVP!  If the game ends in a tie, the game goes into Overtime. If at the end of Overtime the game is still tied, the game continues in Overtime rounds until one player wins and is crowned MVP.*

## Outside resources
+ There are a myriad of ways to play Knockout.  I have included a link to the output of a simple Google search of *Knockout Basketball Game* below:

## Notes for instructor
+ I selected the *MVP Professional Player* version of Knockout where the players only shoot 3-pointers.
+ I used my local production server and Paiza Online PHP Editor to test my code https://paiza.io/projects/3PG2GLRQ6TyK4Pd_d2UCAg
