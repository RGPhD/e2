## Game planning
*Player 1 and Player 2 both shoot a three pointer from the top of the key. Each player will either make their shot or miss their shot. A made shot is worth THREE points; a missed shot is worth ZERO points. The player with the most points wins and is the MVP! If the game ends in a tie, the game goes into one overtime. If at the end of overtime the game is still tied, both players are crowned MVP.*
