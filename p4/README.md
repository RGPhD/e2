## Notes for instructor
+ I added the extra WBA Trivia Challenge game from p3 without database integration.
+ I moved the name and email input form to the WBA Trivia Challenge game. The game does not strictly require the Player to enter their name and or email address to function. However, if the Player does enter their name and or email address, it will be echoed to the page after the output of “WBA Trivia Results:”.
+ I used my local production server and CodePen to test my HTML and CSS code
